# Machine-Learning
   While I have been studying Machine Learning for awhile, I never really proper did it. I have only read books and practice, however, the process is usually slower because I'm not sure about lots of stuffs and don't have any one to ask about. 

  I decided to take a proper class just so I have a concrete idea on what I'm doing and more knowledge in the theory part. The class is [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/). 

    `<addr>`So far it has been really nice experiences. I really enjoy it and and am able to include some stuffs just so I can understand things better. I divided the sections into 2 parts: R and Python as I feel like both will be very handy. 

    `<addr>` Check it out! ;)
